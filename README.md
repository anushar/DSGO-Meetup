# DSGO-Meetup
Meetup at San Diego

Welcome everyone. This repository will help you begin to create your own first but powerful Neural Network.
We will work on a simple dataset but will exploit it as much we can.

We will learn:
1. How to read the dataset using Pandas.
2. Visualize it using Tableau or our favorite MatPlotLib.
3. Normalize it and make it perfect to use it in our analysis and modeling.
4. Divide it to training and testing set.
5. Use a machine learning regression method to predict the future exchange price.
6. Finally build a Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow backend to predict the exchange price.

Download the dataset and follow me. I will code along with you guys and will publish the final code here, which will be available for anyone who wants to use. 

I will end today's session with a homework, which will be exciting and we will work on it together (from our homes)!
